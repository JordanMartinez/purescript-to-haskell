## Real World Demos of Yesod and Servant

- [Real World - Yesod (server) + Persistent-created SQL](https://github.com/tzemanovic/haskell-yesod-realworld-example-app)
- [Real World - Servant (server) + hand-written SQL](https://github.com/dorlowd/haskell-servant-realworld-example-app)

## Performance and Benchmarks

Both frameworks use `warp` as their web server. [The Performance of Open Source Applications](https://www.aosabook.org/en/posa/warp.html) explains why warp is fast.

See how Yesod and Servant compare with other frameworks via the [TechEmpower Framework Benchmakrs](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/). As always, take these benchmarks with a grain of salt and read over their [methodology for producing these results](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=motivation&hw=ph&test=fortune).
