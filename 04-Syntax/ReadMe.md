# Syntax

A few things to keep in mind while comparing the syntax of these two languages:
- Haskell has been in development for a long time. Thus, some syntax decisions were made a long time ago and haven't been changed due to backwards compatibility. Others would be fixed but there hasn't been enough consensus as to what the solution should be. Others can be fixed by enabling some language extensions.
- PureScript was created only a few years ago. It learned from a number of Haskell's "mistakes" and took a different route.
- PureScript's initial compilation target is JavaScript. This target backend has constraints that influenced the design of PureScript's syntax.

## Reading the Code Examples

A short summary of the differences will appear before each section. PureScript's code is presented before Haskell's code.
