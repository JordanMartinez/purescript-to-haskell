# Language Extensions

See the [Haskell Extensions Cheatsheet](https://impurepics.com/posts/2019-08-01-haskell-extensions.html), which appears to only cover the main extensions used

For full explanations of all of them, see the [GHC User Manual's Language Extensions Section](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html)
